# platformer-2d

This is a simple 1 level platformer that I made in a week. I was challenging a friend of mine to create a platformer within a week. We chose to do this so we could keep eachother motivated and accountable.
The development time was around 10-15 hours at max I'd say due to the volume of work I had to deal with on the side. However I still thouroughly enjoyed it. It tought me a lot about generics, delegates,
state patterns, factory patterns, and general game design architecture. I would revisit this sometime to clean up the mess I made in the last few days, but it's nice to have a little archive like this too.
